    <h4>
Museum of the President's Cultural Centre
    </h4>
    <p>
The yurt-shaped Presidential Cultural Centre houses an excellent museum whose highlight is the 2nd floor,
with outstanding collections of Kazakh jewellery and ‘gold and gold-makings’.
These include gold jewellery and replicas from the Scythian burial mounds at Berel and the Issyk burial mound
(where the Golden Man was found), replicas of the Golden Man and the ‘second Golden Man’ from western Kazakhstan,
a bejewelled replica of a horse from the Berel tomb, and real 4th-century-BC horse innards pickled in formaldehyde
