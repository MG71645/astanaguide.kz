Map of Kazakhstan - Atameken
    </h4>
    <p>
It seems impossible to travel around any country in 1 hour. Kazakhstan, which is the 9th largest in the world, seems even more so.
But there is one possibility to do it – you can turn into Gulliver for a while and see the entire country right before your eyes.
Just visit the ethno-memorial complex the “Map of Kazakhstan – Atameken”, designed by renowned architects and designers
