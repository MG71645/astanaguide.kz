    <h4>
Triumphal arch «Mangilik El»
    </h4>
    <p>
Triumphal arch was officially presented by Nursultan Nazarbayev on the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's Independence.
The arch can be seen both from the city itself and from its environs - this is the idea of the authors.
The height of Mangilik El is 20 m. Each meter represents the year of Kazakhstan's independent life.
There is an observation deck, from which you can see the whole city as in the palm of your hand

On the arch there is an inscription "Mangilik El", which came to the modern country, passing centuries - "Eternal people".
The most interesting sight in the corners is decorated with Kazakh ornaments. The arch is faced with granite and beige marble.
In its niches are four figures: a mother woman, as a symbol of the home;
The medieval hero demonstrating the heroic past of Kazakhstan; Aksakal-wise man, symbolizing wisdom, and a modern soldier.
Under each statue there is a solar sign of eternity, which has ancient roots.
The side part of the arch has a depression, where other figures-symbols are placed.
The arch can be reached by an underground passage - it is located at the intersection of two streets
