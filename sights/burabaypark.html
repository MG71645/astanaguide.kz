    <h4>
Burabay National Park
    </h4>
    <p>
Burabay, the resort pearl of Kazakhstan, is a fantastic mountain land harboring mysterious wonders.
Gorgeous pine forests, cliffs formed of neat gigantic natural bricks, and fantastical shapes of peaks resembling sometimes exotic,
sometimes Egyptian pointed pyramids separated by serene lakes
    </p>
    <p>
Burabay National Nature Park often called the ‘Little Switzerland’ of Kazakhstan, –
which is still sometimes referred to by its old name, Borovoye (its official name until 2000) –
is one of Northern Kazakhstan’s most photographed attractions
