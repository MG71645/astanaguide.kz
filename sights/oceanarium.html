Oceanarium
    </h4>
    <p>
The Oceanarium of the Center is a unique building located at a distance of more than 3,000 km from the ocean.
It is the home to about 2,000 animals, representing over 100 species of marine inhabitants from different parts of the Earth.
This was achieved thanks to the unique life-support system that includes a lot of pipes, pumps and filters.
The total volume of water in the system is 3 million liters

The main part of the Oceanarium is the big aquarium, at the bottom of which there is the 70-m glass tunnel.
There you’ll have the opportunity to walk on the seabed only a few centimeters away from sharks.
Twice a day experienced divers take part in the show “Feeding the Sharks”.
In addition to the marine predators the Oceanarium shows piranhas, seahorses, sea anemones, porcupine fish others
