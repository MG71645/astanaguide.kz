Palace of Peace and Reconciliation
    </h4>
    <p>
Palace of Peace and Reconciliation or Pyramid is one of the main attractions in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana.
This amazing building is one of the unique buildings in the world that built in recent years.
Iconic pyramid from famed British architect Norman Foster designed to represent all of the world's religious faiths.
Built between 2004 and 2006 in Kazakhstan’s capital city of Astana, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation
(also known as the Palace of Peace and Accord) is one of the world’s most impressive pyramid designs - second, maybe,
to the Great Pyramids of Egypt, but that’s an argument to be had between fanatics of modern architecture and ancient construction.
