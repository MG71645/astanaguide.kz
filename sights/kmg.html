    <h4>
Round Square
    </h4>
    <p>
The round square is a unique architectural solution complementing the image of Astana as the city of the future.
The construction of the “Round Square” in Astana is the first experiment of placing such a massive object on the compound ground.
It was the first time in Kazakhstan when a high strength concrete was used.
The capital “Round square” is constructed in two levels: down side is built for pedestrians, the top side is for auto transport.
Automobile bridge which crosses the square is the only one in the country as it has been built from a monolithic concrete.
Canadian experts were hired when designing and further inspection of the bridge. The body of the bridge is 2.5 m.
Inside the body there are strained wire cables and empty spaces for engineering communications
