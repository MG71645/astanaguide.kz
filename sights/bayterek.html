    <h4>
Astana-Bayterek monument
    </h4>
    <p>
If you already can not imagine Paris without the Eiffel Tower, the Baiterek Tower ("Poplar" - in Kazakh language)
it firmly became a symbol of modern Astana. The monument symbolizes the Kazakh’s people idea about the universe.
The height of the tower - 105 meters.
At the height of 97 meters there is an observatory - a platform that allows you to see the city from a bird's flight.
The number 97 has not been selected at random. It symbolizes the year when the capital Astana ads

    <p>
White latticed tower crowned by a large glass orb.
This embodies a Kazakh legend in which the mythical bird Samruk lays a golden egg containing the secrets of human desires
and happiness in a tall poplar tree, beyond human reach.
A lift glides visitors up inside the egg, where you can ponder the symbolism,
enjoy expansive views and place your hand in a print of President Nazarbaev’s palm while gazing eastward towards his palace
