    <h4>
Embankment of Ishym River
    </h4>
    <p>
The unhurried flow of the river Ishim makes walks along the embankment one of the pleasant times for the residents and guests of Astana.
Ishim is the personification of the unity of the past and the future, the old and the new, the right and left banks of the Capital
    </p>
    <p>
The Ishimâ€™s course through Astana is traditional place of rest.
The river is lined with embankments, which are a lovely place to walk.
They are a wonderful place to people watch -
older couples and effortlessly elegant Kazakh women with their husbands and babies come here to enjoy the summer sunshine
