    <h4>
National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan
    </h4>
    <p>
The National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan is the youngest and the largest in Central Asia
    </p>
    <p>
The museum opened on 2 July 2014, and visitors are welcomed into the grandiose entry hall by a giant golden eagle
whose wings flap serenely as an interactive screen describes Kazakhstan in all its glory.
Audio guides are available in English for 1000T, and a small cafe serves coffee and refreshments
    </p>
    <p>
This huge blue-glass-and-white-marble museum covers the history and culture of Kazakhstan from ancient to modern times.
Themed halls comprise interactive displays and artifact exhibits,
ranging from a full-sized yurt in the Hall of Ethnography to a chronicle of the capital's modern history in the Hall of Astana.
Don't miss the Golden Hall, which houses several thousand Bronze Age ornaments from the famed 'Golden Man'
(now a national symbol of Kazakhstan) â€“ a 3rd- or 4th-century warrior whose gold-clad remains were uncovered in 1969
