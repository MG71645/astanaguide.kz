    Palace of Peace and Reconciliation or Pyramid is one of the main attractions in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana.
    This amazing building is one of the unique buildings in the world that built in recent years.
    Iconic pyramid from famed British architect Norman Foster designed to represent all of the world's religious faiths.
    Built between 2004 and 2006 in Kazakhstan’s capital city of Astana, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation
    (also known as the Palace of Peace and Accord) is one of the world’s most impressive pyramid designs - second, maybe,
    to the Great Pyramids of Egypt, but that’s an argument to be had between fanatics of modern architecture and ancient construction.

    If you already can not imagine Paris without the Eiffel Tower, the Baiterek Tower ("Poplar" - in Kazakh language)
    it firmly became a symbol of modern Astana. The monument symbolizes the Kazakh’s people idea about the universe.
    The height of the tower - 105 meters.
    At the height of 97 meters there is an observatory - a platform that allows you to see the city from a bird's flight.
    The number 97 has not been selected at random. It symbolizes the year when the capital Astana ads

        <p>
    White latticed tower crowned by a large glass orb.
    This embodies a Kazakh legend in which the mythical bird Samruk lays a golden egg containing the secrets of human desires
    and happiness in a tall poplar tree, beyond human reach.
    A lift glides visitors up inside the egg, where you can ponder the symbolism,
    enjoy expansive views and place your hand in a print of President Nazarbaev’s palm while gazing eastward towards his palace

    Round Square

        <p>
    The round square is a unique architectural solution complementing the image of Astana as the city of the future.
    The construction of the “Round Square” in Astana is the first experiment of placing such a massive object on the compound ground.
    It was the first time in Kazakhstan when a high strength concrete was used.
    The capital “Round square” is constructed in two levels: down side is built for pedestrians, the top side is for auto transport.
    Automobile bridge which crosses the square is the only one in the country as it has been built from a monolithic concrete.
    Canadian experts were hired when designing and further inspection of the bridge. The body of the bridge is 2.5 m.
    Inside the body there are strained wire cables and empty spaces for engineering communications

    It seems impossible to travel around any country in 1 hour. Kazakhstan, which is the 9th largest in the world, seems even more so.
    But there is one possibility to do it – you can turn into Gulliver for a while and see the entire country right before your eyes.
    Just visit the ethno-memorial complex the “Map of Kazakhstan – Atameken”, designed by renowned architects and designers
        </p>
        <p>
    The park was opened on Sept. 8, 2001 by the initiative of President Nazarbayev.
    Such a fun way of presenting histories of cities,countries and peoples is popular in many countries:
    Austria, Belgium, Britain, Germany, Switzerland and others. Around the world there are 17 of similar complexes

    Oceanarium
        </h4>
        <p>
    The Oceanarium of the Center is a unique building located at a distance of more than 3,000 km from the ocean.
    It is the home to about 2,000 animals, representing over 100 species of marine inhabitants from different parts of the Earth.
    This was achieved thanks to the unique life-support system that includes a lot of pipes, pumps and filters.
    The total volume of water in the system is 3 million liters
        </p>
        <p>
    The main part of the Oceanarium is the big aquarium, at the bottom of which there is the 70-m glass tunnel.
    There you’ll have the opportunity to walk on the seabed only a few centimeters away from sharks.
    Twice a day experienced divers take part in the show “Feeding the Sharks”.
    In addition to the marine predators the Oceanarium shows piranhas, seahorses, sea anemones, porcupine fish others

    Triumphal arch «Mangilik El»
        </h4>
        <p>
    Triumphal arch was officially presented by Nursultan Nazarbayev on the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's Independence.
    The arch can be seen both from the city itself and from its environs - this is the idea of the authors.
    The height of Mangilik El is 20 m. Each meter represents the year of Kazakhstan's independent life.
    There is an observation deck, from which you can see the whole city as in the palm of your hand
        </p>
        <p>
    On the arch there is an inscription "Mangilik El", which came to the modern country, passing centuries - "Eternal people".
    The most interesting sight in the corners is decorated with Kazakh ornaments. The arch is faced with granite and beige marble.
    In its niches are four figures: a mother woman, as a symbol of the home;
    The medieval hero demonstrating the heroic past of Kazakhstan; Aksakal-wise man, symbolizing wisdom, and a modern soldier.
    Under each statue there is a solar sign of eternity, which has ancient roots.
    The side part of the arch has a depression, where other figures-symbols are placed.
    The arch can be reached by an underground passage - it is located at the intersection of two streets
